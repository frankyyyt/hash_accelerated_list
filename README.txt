This project implements a linked list with with hash-table indexing and unique items only.
Stores only unique items (extendable to non-uniques with worse worst-case runtime complexity)
Search becomes O(1) for known items, but as opposed to a hash table, it keeps the item ordering.

TODO:
Implement proper iterators
Rename the class to something more sensible
