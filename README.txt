This project implements a linked list with hash-table indexing and unique items only.
Stores only unique items (extendable to non-uniques with worse worst-case runtime complexity)
This data structure keeps the O(1) times of a hash table, but keeps the item ordering.

In Java, this data structure is called a LinkedHashMap.

Since I only wrote this to familiarize myself with C++'s STL & iterators, don't expect the API to be nice or complete.

TODO:
Implement proper iterators and a nicer API
Rename the class to something more sensible
More tests
